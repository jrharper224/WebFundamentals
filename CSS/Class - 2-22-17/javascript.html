        <h3>JavaScript Basis</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, objet-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developersto take a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provided programmatic control over them.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the up hold the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScipt variables must be identfied with unique names. These names are called identifiers. <span class="var">var x;</span></li>
            <li><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - out cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="var">var x = 10;</span></li>
            <li><a href="">Data Types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class = "var">true</span> or <span class = "var">false;</span> null - <span class = "var">null</span> aka norhting; Number - <span class = "var">42</span> or <span class = "var">3.14159;</span> String - <span class = "var">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class = "var">[1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <<span class = "var">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></li>
            <li><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different ations for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class = "var">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class = "var">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class = "var">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
            <li><a href = "">Loops</a> There are many different inds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
            <li><a href="">Function</a> Funcctions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. THink of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly there are a ton ore tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
